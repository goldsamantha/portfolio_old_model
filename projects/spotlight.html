        The key differentiator of the app is the leaderboard page.
        It is crucial for this page to be immediately informative and engaging.
        Initially the app had a static leaderboard that showcased the top ten
        contestants, but didn't reveal much more information.
        As the app grew so did the demand for contests, and it was clear the
        app needed some re-thinking.
        I led a major redesign to refresh the app and improve functionality
        for showcasing multiple contests.

      <div class = "dark-text content-inner side-pad-wide top-pad">
        <p>
          The new leaderboard needed to showcase and differentiate multiple
          contests and leaders in those challenges.
          After many iterations and tests with toggling pages to navigate through
          a list of contests, I decided to divide the leaderboard
          two distinct pages &mdash; one that showed a list of multiple
          contests and one that showcased details from a contest. This allows
           easy access for users who wanted to
          view a specific contest's page with a single tap, rather than toggling
          through a number of pages before finding the right one.
          <br><br>
          In the new detail view, we highlight more information
          about the contestants, primarily those in the lead. In previous
          versions of the app the leaderboard had no visual assets and was
          simply a list of leading contestants from 1 to 100. The new
          detailed contest view makes it easy to identify the winners
          while saving valuable screen
          real estate. The new view enables the user to
          follow winning contestants directly from the contest page.
          Since those players tended to be the
          most popular in the app, this removed the step
          of clicking into their profile page and then following.
          <br><br>
          Before the re-design there was no central hub that encorportated all
          data relevant to a contest. In other words the leaderboard showed winners
          but no other information. I added a section for a contest description
          and image as well as a stream so that users could actually see what posts
          were being entered into a contest.

        <p>
          Along with adding new pages and components for the leaderboard, I
          refreshed the UI for the Spotlight App from the MVP model to maturity.
          After completing wireframes and restructuring the sign-up flow to
          make the onboarding process easier, I adapted the visuals.
          I lightened the header color, updated the app's navigation icons,
          and improved the feed with a card-layout which differentiated each post
          from one another and showcased the most relevant detials of a post
          such as author, title, and time-posted.
          I also adapted the notifications page to provide more
          meaningful alerts. For instance, I added notifications to be sent to users
          when they, or someone they follow, placed in the top three. I modified
          the UI of the page as well from a single list that only had text to a
          layout which featured imagery to make notifications from friends and
          followers more rapidly recognizeable.
